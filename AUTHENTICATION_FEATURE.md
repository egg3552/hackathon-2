# User Authentication Feature - Complete ✅

## User Story
**As a user**, I should be able to register and log in so that I can securely access my meeting notes.

## Acceptance Criteria - ALL MET ✅

### ✅ Criterion 1: User Registration
**Given** an email and password, a user can register an account.

**Implementation:**
- **URL:** `/register/`
- **View:** `views.register()` in `app/views.py`
- **Form:** Django's built-in `UserCreationForm`
- **Template:** `app/templates/register.html`
- **Fields:**
  - Username (required, max 150 characters)
  - Password (required, min 8 characters)
  - Password confirmation (required, must match)

**Features:**
- Beautiful gradient UI matching the landing page design (#667eea → #764ba2)
- Real-time field validation with helpful error messages
- Password strength requirements enforced
- Success message on registration: "Account created for {username}! You can now log in."
- Automatic redirect to login page after successful registration

### ✅ Criterion 2: User Login and Dashboard Access
**Then** the user can log in and access their dashboard.

**Implementation:**
- **URL:** `/login/`
- **View:** Django's built-in `LoginView`
- **Template:** `app/templates/login.html`
- **Redirect:** `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'dashboard'` in `settings.py`
- **Dashboard URL:** `/dashboard/`
- **Dashboard View:** `@login_required` decorator ensures security

**Features:**
- Secure authentication using Django's auth system
- Beautiful gradient login form
- Error messages for invalid credentials
- Link to registration page for new users
- After login, users are automatically redirected to their personalized dashboard
- Dashboard shows:
  - Meetings created by the user
  - Meetings the user is attending

### ✅ Criterion 3: Persistent Authentication
**When** logged in, the user remains authenticated across pages until they log out.

**Implementation:**
- **Session Management:** Django's built-in session framework
- **Security:** All protected views use `@login_required` decorator
- **Logout:** `/logout/` route with `LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'index'`
- **Login Required Pages:**
  - `/dashboard/` - User dashboard
  - `/meetings/` - Meeting list
  - `/meetings/create/` - Create meeting
  - `/meetings/<id>/` - Meeting detail
  - `/meetings/<id>/edit/` - Edit meeting
  - `/meetings/<id>/delete/` - Delete meeting
  - All note and attendee management pages

**Security Configuration (`settings.py`):**
```python
LOGIN_URL = 'login'
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'dashboard'
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'index'

# Production security (when DEBUG=False)
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000
```

**Session Features:**
- Users stay logged in across page navigation
- Session persists browser refresh
- Session cookies are secure (HTTPOnly, Secure in production)
- Users must explicitly log out to end session
- Inactive sessions expire automatically (Django default: 2 weeks)
